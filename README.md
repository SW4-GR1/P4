# P4
Repository for managing code on the P4 project on Aalborg University Copenhagen - Software.

The project aims to design, define, and implement a compiler for a programming language.


To run the current version of the frontend go inside the frontend/ directory. run ```make clean``` and ```make``` to run the lexer with test.yay. Ignore the makefile error if it comes up.

Run ```make tests``` to execute some simple tests which prints parse trees.
